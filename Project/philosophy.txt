Prelude
=======
Twas the night before christmas, 
when all through the city, 
no creatures were stirring. 
Except a Mouse... 
Though if I had my way, 
I'd leave the creatures to their stirrings.
I'm getting too old for this.

Please, someone, kill the alarm.'

Your cat just stares at you and purrs. One of the old companion AI models you... acquired... a while ago. Off grid, so way behind the latest models, but that's the way it has to be. No way they'd let you, a lowly contractor, keep her if they found you had her.

You give her a few scritches behind the ears.</color>\n 'If only I could teach you to make coffee.'\n <color='#B0B0B0'>She just responds by booping you on the head.</color>\n 'Yes I'm getting up.'

1AM Christmas morning. Laptop glowing with new work. Time to see what the boss has for you today.

Best to avoid carrying while working. The Police tend to be less believing you when you try to explain you're not up to nefarious purposes. But in this apartment block? It stays close.

Yeah, yeah, I'll clean up tomorrow. She said, for the 10th time this week.

'Lucky you are adorable'

You know damn well your fridge is empty. You do aught to get off your butt and buy some food.

Take a seat, friend.
You look down on your luck.
Another victim of the corp
hegemony?
<color="#999999">You nod.</color>
Who did you work for?
<color="#999999">You flash your useless Nisana ID.</color>
Hungry?
<color="#999999">You nod again.</color>
Toppings?
<color="#999999">You shrug.</color>
The works, then.

A good evening starts with a
good hotdog, friend.

1
==
Welcome back. Still hungry?
Good. Hungry sells more hotdogs.

2
==
You get a lot of bad advice
while unemployed.
Here's some good advice,
hot dogs don't give bad advice.


3
==
Want my advice, friend?
It's best not to find out
how the hot dog is made

4
==
They say, friend,
that you should grab life with 
both hands. I say, two hands
equals two hotdogs.

5
==
Is a hot dog a sandwich?
Can a sandwich fulfill 
the dark part of your soul
like a hot dog does?

6
==
Friend, the best time to 
eat a hot dog is now.

7
==
One hot dog, 
served with everything.
Nirvana.

8
==
People say you should not eat 
the buns. That's absurd.

9
==
Life is hard. Picking the
right condiment is harder.


10
==
A fully loaded hot dog can be 
a difficult burden to bear

11
==
They call hot dogs cheap, 
as if it's an insult. 
Who's satisfied now?

12
==
Friend, acquiring 
the hot dog isn't the 
purpose of life. Consuming it is.

13
==
Friend, do not desire 
another's hot dog. 
Yours is on it's way.

14
==
You cannot control much 
in life. But you can control 
what condiments you put on.

15
==
Very little is needed for 
happiness. Sausage, bun. 
Simple.

16
==
No man eating a hot dog is 
unhappy.

17
==
Tomorrow's hot dog is a reason 
to survive today.

18
==
A mouthful of hot dog 
prevents saying stupid things.

19
==
A split hot dog still tastes 
delicious.

20
==
Sometimes the condiments 
fall off. Such is life.

21
==
Friend, we don't live forever. 
Eat the hot dog while it's 
hot.

22
==
The hot dog only succeeds 
with the bun's support.

23
==
A hot dog is a hot dog. 
That is the long and the 
thick of it.


24
==
A good life is like a 
good hot dog. 
Long, delicious, and messy.
