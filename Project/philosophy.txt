Take a seat, friend.
You look down on your luck.
Another victim of the corp
hegemony?
<color="#999999">You nod.</color>
Who did you work for?
<color="#999999">You flash your Arisana ID.</color>
Hungry?
<color="#999999">You nod again.</color>
Toppings?
<color="#999999">You shrug.</color>
The works, then.
<color="#999999">He slides you the hotdog.</color>

A good evening starts with a
good hotdog, friend.

1
==
Welcome back. Still hungry?
Good. Hungry sells more hotdogs.

2
==
You get a lot of bad advice
while unemployed.
Here's some good advice,
hot dogs don't give bad advice.


3
==
Want my advice, friend?
It's best not to find out
how the hot dog is made

4
==
They say, friend,
that you should grab life with 
both hands. I say, two hands
equals two hotdogs.

5
==
Is a hot dog a sandwich?
Can a sandwich fulfill 
the dark part of your soul
like a hot dog does?

6
==
Friend, the best time to 
eat a hot dog is now.

7
==
One hot dog, 
served with everything.
Nirvana.

8
==
People say you should not eat 
the buns. That's absurd.

9
==
Life is hard. Picking the
right condiment is harder.


10
==
A fully loaded hot dog can be 
a difficult burden to bear

11
==
They call hot dogs cheap, 
as if it's an insult. 
Who's satisfied now?

12
==
Friend, acquiring 
the hot dog isn't the 
purpose of life. Consuming it is.

13
==
Friend, do not desire 
another's hot dog. 
Yours is on it's way.

14
==
You cannot control much 
in life. But you can control 
what condiments you put on.

15
==
Very little is needed for 
happiness. Sausage, bun. 
Simple.

16
==
No man eating a hot dog is 
unhappy.

17
==
Tomorrow's hot dog is a reason 
to survive today.

18
==
A mouthful of hot dog 
prevents saying stupid things.

19
==
A split hot dog still tastes 
delicious.

20
==
Sometimes the condiments 
fall off. Such is life.

21
==
Friend, we don't live forever. 
Eat the hot dog while it's 
hot.

22
==
The hot dog only succeeds 
with the bun's support.

23
==
A hot dog is a hot dog. 
That is the long and the 
thick of it.


24
==
A good life is like a 
good hot dog. 
Long, delicious, and messy.
