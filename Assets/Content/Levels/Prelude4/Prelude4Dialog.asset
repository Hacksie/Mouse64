  - <color='#B0B0B0'>Before you can twitch, you are surrounded by Nisana Paras.</color>
  - <color='#B0B0B0'>Then, taking his sweet time, your boss, Manager Lyon, walks
    up to you.</color>
  - Search her.
  - <color='#B0B0B0'>The Paras quickly remove your PP7 and tonight's data shard.</color>
  - <color='#B0B0B0'>Mr Lyon makes a show of scanning the shard before pocketing
    it.</color>
  - Tsk tsk, Ms Hart. I came here personally to inform you, with the recent merger
    of RKB
  - your position at Nisana has been restructured. Ms Snow will be replacing you,
    going forward.
  - But this is serious, isn't it? A conspiracy to commit espionage against a Nisana
    subsidary,
  - possession of an illegal firearm, and, I am informed, possession of banned class
    C AI Tech.
  - I could hand you over to the Nisana Paras and be done with you.
  - But it's christmas and I'm feeling lenient.
  - All benefits, protections and citizenship provided by the Nisana corporation
    are
  - hereby revoked. You are now a free agent of Ruby City. Good luck.
