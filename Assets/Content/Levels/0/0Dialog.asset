  - Take a seat, friend.
  - A fresh victim of the corp hegemony?
  - You look like you have the unemployment blues.
  - <color="#999999">You nod and toss your old Nisana ID on the counter.</color>
  - <color="#999999">He nods, knowingly.</color> Ah. Such partings can be difficult.
    Are you hungry?
  - <color="#999999">You shake your head.</color>
  - You sure look it, my friend. Toppings?
  - <color="#999999">You flash him a confused look.</color>
  - Oh, you look like you could use the works.
  - <color="#999999">He slides you a hot dog and a napkin.</color>
  - <color="#999999">Scrawled on it is a name and the address of a corp.</color>
  - <color="#999999">Underneath, loaded with 6 rounds of .357 magnum, is a Mateba
    autorevolver.</color>
  - <color="#999999">A relic of an begone world. A giant fist full of anger. Fitting.</color>
  - You see? A good evening starts with a fine hotdog, friend.
